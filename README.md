### Hi there 👋

I'll polish my github when I'm available.

- 🤔 I'm doing my Ph.D @Circuits and Systems Group, TU Delft, with Dr. Geethu Joseph.
- 📫 How to reach me: Through LinkedIn! https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanbin-he-10b154198/



- 🔭 I obtained my master's degree @TU Delft, the Netherlands. My master's thesis is on spectral clustering problem over large time-varying graph, which can be found through http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:f9314ad7-07ee-4aaf-850d-04d03233ca00.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on signal processing in Intelligent Reflected Surfaces (IRS) channel estimation.
