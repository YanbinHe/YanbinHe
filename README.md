### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm currently a master's student @TU Delft, the Netherlands.
I'll polish my github when I'm available.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on spectral clustering problem over large time-varying graph.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nothing, but I'd like to learn Java, some popular DL frameworks, basic data structures and algorithms.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for Ph.D position.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Through LinkedIn!
